<!-- ## Logical Assertions -->

<!-- Before we jump headfirst data wrangling, we first need to practice a core idea that underlies how many of these functions work. -->

<!-- Many of the functions and operations we will encounter in R rely on *logical assertions*. A logical assertion is a statement that can be either true or false (in R, of course, `TRUE` or `FALSE`). Let's look at an example first. -->

<!-- To begin, let's ask R whether 10 is greater than 5: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- 10 > 5 -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- R sensibly returns `TRUE`. Essentially, we are making a claim (10 is greater than 5) and R tells us whether that claim, or assertion, is true or not. Similarly, we can assert that 5 is greater than 10: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- 5 > 10 -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- And R again, very sensibly, tells us that we're wrong (`FALSE`). So far so good! -->

<!-- ### Vectors -->

<!-- In the next step, we're going to meet a foundational piece of the way R works: the **vector**. Vectors are essentially one-dimensional lists of pieces of information. What this means is that instead of asking R about one number at a time, we could po -->

The Console is deceptively simple: just the `>` symbol with a flashing cursor after it, waiting for you to type something. However, the Console is the heart of R, where anything you want to do actually happens. Every command that you type, anything you want R to do, goes through here.

So - let's get cracking.

## Making Mistakes

Before we go any further, an affirmation: you will, inevitably, make typos and errors using R. You will write commands that make sense to you that R doesn't understand; and you will write commands that **don't** make sense to you, that R **does** understand. You will make lots of mistakes, so let's start there: with errors.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercises"}
Type literally any gibberish, words, keysmashes etc. into the code chunk on the worksheet and press Run (or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Enter).

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
## Keysmash!
aslavb;lj aew aljvb
```

```{r}
## Words!
Am I a coward? Who calls me villain?
```

```{r}
## Emojis! 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```
:::
:::

Well, that went about as well as expected.

If you haven't tried this yet, and your code chunk is just ominously staring at you, I'm serious - smash your head into the keyboard if you have to, or let your cat walk on it, or play it as if it were a piano, and press Enter. There's two important things to learn from this:

1.  To ask R to do something, you must write them out somewhere (in a code chunk, in the Console) and then run them.

2.  Eventually, inevitably, something that you type WILL produce an error.

From our keysmashing above, you will have seen that `aslavb;lj aew aljvb`, `Am I a coward? Who calls me villain?`, and `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` are not valid commands in R. In other words, although each of these has [a communicative function for humans](https://www.cjr.org/language_corner/keysmash-qwerty-asdf.php), R can't understand them. In order to get the answer that we want, we have to ask R to do something in a way it can understand, by writing commands it can parse (i.e. decipher) using the R language.

### GlossoRlia

Just like learning any other language, learning to communicate with R takes time and practice, and it can be very frustrating when you and R can't seem to understand each other. However, one advantage of learning to talk to R vs learning to speak a human language is that R always works the same way. It doesn't get angry or sullen or sarcastic; it won't ignore you or get impatient even if you ask it the same question a thousand times; and even if the response it gives doesn't make sense to you, there's always a logical reason for what it does.

Although it certainly is complex, and occasionally quite frustrating, R is just a system for doing computational and analytical tasks. It's powerful, and the very fact that you can do so much with it also means there's a lot to learn. But it *is* comprehensible, and ultimately it's just a tool to help you do your work well.

## Types of Data

One key concept for using R is the different ways it categorises data. "Data" here means any piece of information you put into R - a word, a number, the result of a command or calculation, a dataset, etc. Depending on the type of data you have, R will treat it differently, and some operations only work on certain types of data. So, let's have a look at how R encodes and deals with different types of data. Here's well cover three of the most common and important: numeric, character, and logical.

### Numeric

The first, and most obvious, type of data in R is numbers. Once again, let's create a new code chunk and see what happens.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Type any single number and run the code.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
# Pick any number at random

3958
```
:::
:::

::: callout-tip
Remember that you can run all the code in a code chunk by pressing Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Enter on your keyboard, or by clicking the green "play" arrow in the top right corner of the chunk.

You can also run only a particular line of code, or something that you've highlighted, by pressing Ctrl/Cmd + Enter.
:::

This might be what you'd expect. We've essentially asked R, "Give me 3958" (or whatever number you put in) and R obliges. The only thing that might be a surprise is the `[1]` marker, called an **index**. Basically, R has replied, "The first thing (`[1]`) that you asked me for is 3958." We'll come back to this in a moment.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
How does R handle commas within a number (e.g. to separate the thousands place from the hundreds)? How about full stops for decimals?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
3,958
```

```{r}
3.958
```
:::
:::

So, commas within numbers throw an error. This is because commas have an important role to play in functions, so long numbers must be inputted into R without any punctuation. However, full stops to mark decimal places are just fine.

::: {.callout-tip title="Grammar Check" collapse="true"}
Try for a moment switching to Source mode by clicking the `Source` button in the upper left hand of your Quarto document. You can see that RStudio helpfully marks out the part of the code that isn't parsable (not in "grammatical" R) with a red ❌ next to the line number, and squiggly red underlining, likely familiar from word processing programmes, under the part of the code that's causing the issue. It won't do this for every error, but it's very helpful for finding "grammatical" errors like extra or missing brackets or misplaced commas.
:::

Next, let's try doing some basic maths.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Add together your shoe size and the number of windows in the room you're currently in.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
40 + 8
```
:::
:::

Important to note here is that we don't need to type an `=` to get the answer, just the equation we want to solve and press Enter. Again, we've asked R, "Give me 40 + 8" (or whatever numbers you chose) and R replies with the answer.

You will not be surprised to learn that you can use R as a calculator to subtract, divide, and multiply as well.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Try subtracting, dividing, and multiplying the same two numbers.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
40 - 8
40 * 8
40 / 8
```
:::
:::

#### Vectors {#vectors}

Let's imagine I want to generate some simple participant ID numbers to keep track of the order that they completed my study, and I had 50 in total. I could do this by typing every number out one by one, but this is exactly the kind of tedious nonsense that computers are great at. Instead, we'll use the operator `:`, which means "every whole number between".

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Print out every whole number between 1 and 50.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
1:50
```
:::
:::

Notice that the indices mentioned earlier have come up again. The first element after the \[*n*\] index is the *n*th element. Let's have a look at this some more.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Print out all the numbers 12 through 30; all of the numbers 23 through 55; and 36, all in one command.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
c(12:30, 23:55, 36)
```
:::
:::

You may have tried something like this:

```{r}
12:30
23:55
36
```

As you can see from the markers, this is three separate commands, because the numbered indices start over from `[1]` each time. However, we want all those numbers *in a single command*. To do this, I'm going to use a **function** called `c()`.

This is our first contact with functions in R, and [we'll explore how they work more later on](01_02_intro.qmd#functions). To use this one, type it out, then inside the brackets, put the numbers you want to **c**ollect (or **c**oncatenate, or **c**ombine), with different groups separated by commas.

```{r}
c(12:30, 23:55, 36)
```

As you can see from the numbered indices this time, when I put the numbers I want inside the function `c()`, separated by commas, R **c**ollects all of the numbers into a single series of elements, called a **vector**.

Actually, we've been looking at vectors this whole time. Any series of pieces of information in R is a vector (but see Tip box on vectors and elements). When we were looking at single numbers (like `3958` above), we were still getting a vector back from R, but it was a vector with only one element, and thus only `[1]`.

If I want the *n*th element in the vector we've just created, (say, the 88th), I can get it out using the numbered markers by **indexing** with square brackets.

```{r}
c(12:30, 23:55, 36)[33]
```

What I've essentially asked R is, "Put all of these numbers into a single vector, and then give me the 33th element in that vector." As it turns out, the 33th element in that vector of numbers is 36.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition: Vectors"}
A **vector** is essentially a series of pieces of data, or **elements**. It is a key basic piece of how data is stored in R. When R returns a vector as the output from a command, each element is numbered in square brackets. These square brackets can also be used to **index** the vector to get the *n*th element.

For **atomic vectors** created with `c()` or similar operations, there are some important rules:

1.  Each element must be scalar (i.e. of length 1)
2.  All of the elements must have the same data type (or will be coerced)

For a complete explanation of vectors (and their more versatile siblings, lists) that's beyond the scope of this tutorial, see:

1.  [This excellent explainer on vectors and lists](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/bk00_vectors-and-lists.html)
2.  [R for Data Science chapter 20](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html)
:::

#### Vector Calculations

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Create a vector of every whole number between 37 and 63, and subtract 7 from each one.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
c(37:63) - 7
```
:::
:::

This could be a *very* tedious process, but here we have an example of a **vectorised operation**. By default, the operation "subtract 7" is automatically applied to each individual element of the vector.

We can do a lot more than this with numbers and data in R, but this is an excellent start. Just one note before we move on about the order in which R performs its calculations.

::: {.callout-tip title="Order of Operations"}
Mathematical expressions are evaluated in a certain order of priority. You can use brackets to tell R which part of a longer calculation to do first, e.g.:

```{r}
59 * (401 + 5)
```

Without the brackets, the expression is evaluated from left to right, which in this case would give a different answer:

```{r}
59 * 401 + 5
```

Whenever there's any chance for ambiguity, always use brackets to make sure the calculation is performed correctly.
:::

### Character

Characters are a more general data category that also includes letters and words. In R, strings of letters or words must be enclosed in either 'single' or "double" quotes, otherwise R will try to read them as code:

```{r}
Hello world!
```

```{r}
"Hello world!"
```

As you can see here, the first command without quotes throws an error, whereas the second prints out our command just like it did with the single numbers before.

An important thing to note is that R sees everything inside a pair of quotes as a single element, regardless of how long it is. You can see this in the indices we saw before:

```{r}
"Hi!"
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness..."
```

The `[1]` markers also tell us that each of the two strings above already constitute vectors, each of length 1. Just like we saw with numbers, above, any number of character strings can be combined into a vector. You can also use the numbered markers to extract the *n*th element in that vector.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Create a vector containing the first five animals you think of, then print the 3rd one.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
c("bumblebee", "squid", "falcon", "flea", "seagull")[3]
```
:::
:::

The placement of the quotes is very important - they can't include the commas. As we said before, R uses commas to separate different elements. So, if you didn't enclose each word in quotes separately with commas in between, you would have had this odd message:

```{r}
c("bumblebee, squid, falcon, flea, seagull")[3]
```

`NA` is a special value in R. It indicates that something is **n**ot **a**vailable, and it usually represents missing data, or that a calculation has gone wrong or can't be performed properly.

Here, we asked R for the third element in a vector that, as far as R can tell, only contained one. This is because there's only one pair of quotes, so all five animals and the commas between them are considered to be one element. Since there isn't a third element, R has informed us so accordingly - the answer to our query is `NA`, doesn't exist. This isn't what we wanted, but R is not in the wrong here, because it's done precisely what we told it to do.

### Logical

The final type of data that we'll look at for now is logical data. In addition to performing calculations and printing out words, R can also tell you whether a particular statement is `TRUE` or `FALSE.` To do this, we can use logical operators to form an **assertion**, and then R will tell us the result.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Write the following assertions in R:

-   5 is greater than 10
-   6 is less than 12
-   27 is less than or equal to 27
-   49 does not equal 93
-   420 equals 42

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
5 > 10
6 < 12
27 <= 27
49 != 93
420 == 42
```
:::
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Asserting Equivalence"}
The last couple statements above may have caused you some trouble if the notation is unfamiliar.

For "does not equal", `!` is common notation in R for "not", or the reverse of something. So `!=` can be read as "not-equals".

For "equals", if you tried this with a single equals sign, you would have had a strange error:

```{r}
420 = 42
```

The problem is that in R, the single equals sign `=` is equivalent to the assignment operator `<-`, which we'll learn how to use shortly. Single `=` also has an important and specific role to play in function arguments. Essentially `=` is a special operator that doesn't assert equivalance. Instead, "exactly equals" in R is "double-equals" (or "exactly and only"), `==`.
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Use a single command to ask R whether the numbers 2 through 10 are less than or equal to 6.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
2:10 <= 6
```
:::
:::

Here R prints out a value of `TRUE` or `FALSE` for each comparison it's asked to make. So, the first element in the output (`TRUE`) corresponds to the statement `2 <= 6`, the second to `3 <= 6`, and so on. This is a vectorised calculation again, as we saw with numeric data before. These vectorised assertions will be absolutely essential to [selecting and filtering data](..\02_essentials\06_filter.qmd) that meet particular requirements, or checking our data to find problems.

## Class and Coercion

With these short examples, it may be obvious just by looking that `25` is a number and `porcupine` is a word. However, this isn't always so straightforward, and there are some situations - such as data checking/cleaning, or debugging - where we might want to check what type of data a certain thing is. To do this, we'll need another new function, `class()`. This function will print out, as a character, the name of the data type of whatever is put into the brackets.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Use the `class()` function to get R to print the values `"numeric"`, `"logical"`, and `"character"`.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
## Any numeric vector will do
class(216907)

## You can also use a longer vector of numbers
## as long as they are all numbers!
class(c(4:291, -1, 38.7, 100000000))

## Logical has two options
## Create a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs
class(TRUE)

## Create a vector that outputs logical values (now you're thinking with functions!)
class(c(6 > 4, 10 == 37, 3 != 8))

## Character
class("antidisestablishmentarianism")
```
:::

What data type does R give you if you combine numbers and characters in `c()`?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
## Again, anything will do

class(c(93, -1905, "avocado"))
```
:::
:::

Something interesting has happened here. Recall that atomic vectors created with `c()` must all have the same data type. Here, we combined two types of data: numeric and character. We didn't get an error - instead, without warning or telling us, R quietly converted the entire vector to `character` type. This forcible conversion is called **coersion**.

::: {.callout-tip title="Coersion"}
Coersion is when a piece of data is forcibly changed from one data type to another. This is sometimes intentional, but it can happen unintentionally (and without any warning or fanfare!), so is a common source of errors.

Coersion follows a hierarchy; data types on the left can be coerced into the types further along to the right.

logical ==\> integer ==\> double (numeric) ==\> character

As we saw previously, you can check the data type of a vector with `class()`. You can also check if a vector is a particular type (and receive a logical vector in response) with the `is.*()` family of functions. (The `*` notation refers to a placeholder for many different options, such as `is.numeric`, `is.character`, etc.)

You can similarly (try to) coerce a vector into a particular data type with the `as.*()` family of functions.
:::

This explains why our vector from the last exercise was a `character` vector - since the vector contained at least one character element, everything else in the vector was coerced to the same type. This can cause problems when, for example, numeric data is coerced into character data, even though it still *looks like* numbers.

Even though we can do mathematical operations on numbers, we can't do them on characters; it should be clear that asking e.g. what is `"tomato" - 7` is nonsense. However, this is the case even if all of the data are numerals! For example:

```{r}
## No problem here; all numbers
c(2:20, 45) - 7

## Doesn't work
c(2:20, "45") - 7
```

Even though "45" looks like a number, because it's in quotes, R thinks that it's a character, and will refuse to do the calculation, in the same way that it would refuse to do it with "tomato".

## Objects

R is a programming language, but (being created by speakers of natural language) it has many features similar or analogous to natural languages. In this section, we'll cover the basic "grammar" of R, including how R understands what you ask it to do.

In a similar way that the basic unit of many languages is the word[^1], the basic unit of the R programming language is the **object**. This section will explore the basics of what an object is and some of their key features in R.

[^1]: As a linguist I have to note, one, [words don't exist](https://amazingakita.tumblr.com/post/181685581034/people-who-dont-even-care-about-language-how-can), and two, the closest linguistic term for what an object is is probably "lexeme". "Word" will get you in the right vicinity, though, conceptually. If you'd like to dive down this rabbit hole (rabbit-hole?) [this Crash Course video on morphology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93sK4jTGrss) is a good place to start.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition: Objects"}
Objects are the basic elements that R is built around - the equivalent of words. An "object" in R is any bit of information that is stored with a particular name. Objects can hold anything, from a single number or word to huge datasets with thousands of data points or complex graphs. These named objects are the main way you, the programmer, can store, retrieve, and interact with information in R.
:::

### Creating an Object

Although we have done quite a bit in R so far - creating vectors, doing calculations, etc. - you may notice that we haven't stored this information anywhere. To store the output of code for further use, it needs to be **assigned** to an object using the assignment operator, `<-`. Once an object is created, it will appear in the Environment pane.

::: {.callout-important title="Clear Your Environment"}
At the moment your Environment should be empty. As a reminder, Environment is by default the first (leftmost) tab in one of your four main windows in RStudio, probably the one on the top right.

If this window is blank except for "Environment is empty", you're ready to go. If for some reason it isn't empty, click the broom icon to clear everything from your Environment before you get started, as indicted in the image below. (There will be a very ominous-sounding "Are you sure?" pop-up, but just click "Yes".)

![](..\..\images\clear_env.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the Environment pane in RStudio, with the 'Clear objects from workspace' broom icon circled, along with the 'Yes' button on the subsequent pop-up."}
:::

First, let's look at the foundational structure of almost everything you will do in R:

```         
object <- instructions
```

This is "pseudo-code", or a "general format" for a command in R. It isn't valid R code, but is rather intended as a midpoint between natural language and R to help make it clear how the code works. You can read this code as, "An object is created from (`<-`) some instructions."

-   `object`: Objects can be named almost anything (although see Naming, below). The object name is a label so you, the analyst, can find, refer to, and use the information you need.
-   `<-`: The assignment operator `<-` has single job: to assign output to names, or in other words, to create objects.
-   `instructions`: Any amount of code that produces some output, which is what `object` will contain.

::: {.callout-tip title="Naming Objects" collapse="true"}
COMING SOON
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Think of a research scenario familiar to you with two independent groups. You're welcome to draw from your own research or expertise, but you should choose something with numerical scores. Some ideas include:

1.  Reaction times on a button-pressing task from a control and an experimental intervention group
2.  Statistics anxiety scores from first and second year UG students
3.  Quiz marks from students with practicals scheduled 9am and students with practicals at 6pm

Make a note of the scenario you chose. Then, create two new objects: one that contains a vector of seven scores from the first of the two groups, and the second that has seven different scores from the second group.

*Hint*: Just make up some numbers!

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
Choosing scenario 3, this vector contains some hypothetical quiz marks from each class.

```{r}
quiz_9am <- c(75, 58, 62, 14, 33, 67, 55)
quiz_6pm <- c(45, 90, 27, 65, 39, 77, 48)
```

Let's have a look at this command. On the left side I've written the name I want my new object to have, which I've called `quiz_9am[^1]`. Next, the assignment operator `<-` assigns whatever comes after it to the object label `quiz_scores_9am`. Finally, I've written instructions for what I want this object to contain: in this case, a vector of numbers that I've made up, but that reasonably look like quiz scores.

\[\^1\]: I could have called it anything, like `the_first_example_of_an_object_InThisSection.so.far` or `made_upQuizScores.fornineamclass` or anything else that follows R's naming conventions. However, it's a good idea to name your objects something brief and obvious, so you can remember what they contain.

If you haven't done this yet, do so now, even if you've looked at the solution rather than trying it for yourself first. Once you've typed the command, there's a final step to actually create the object: you have to **run** the command in order for it to take effect. As a reminder, you can do this by clicking the green ▶️ button in the upper right corner of the code chunk, or by pressing Ctrl/Cmd + Enter when your cursor is blinking on the same line as the code you want to run.
:::
:::

Assuming your code is valid, you should see a green bar appear along the left-hand side of the code chunk when you run the code, but you might notice that there's no printout that appears under the code chunk, as there was previously. In fact, if the code ran successfully, it might look like nothing happened at all. To find out what *did* happen, look your Environment pane. You should now see a new section, "Values", and underneath the name of your new object and what it contains. Success!

### Calling an Object

For any object, from the most simple to the most complex, you can always see what's in it by **calling** the object. This simply means that you type the name of the object and run the code. R will print out whatever is stored in the object.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Call both of the objects you just created.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
Replace with the name of the object you created, if you did something different.

```{r}
quiz_9am
quiz_6pm
```
:::
:::

This output looks just like what we saw earlier, when we just asked R to print out a vector of numbers. In essence, the object names are just labels for storing and referring to the information they contain.

::: {.callout-warning title="Creating vs Calling"}
These two actions are the essential basis of everything you will do in R. All of your code will, at base, either create an object, or call an object. (Changing an existing object, as we'll see shortly, is the exact same procedure as creating one from scratch.)

When you **create** an object using the assignment operator (`<-`), the object is created but is **not** printed out. This is because R always does only and exactly what you ask it to do, and using the assignment operator only tells R to assign something to an object, not to print it out.

When you **call** an object, the current contents of that object are printed out, but that object is **not** changed - you only reproduce a copy of its contents for review. To create or change an object, you must use the assignment operator to assign the output to a new (or existing) object name.
:::

Let's make all of this a bit more concrete by seeing how we can use objects effectively.

### Using Objects

Since objects are convenient reference labels for the information they contain, we can work with them as if they *were* the information they contain. In this case, our objects contain numbers, so we can use them for numerical calculations.

For instance, we might want to know what the **mean** mark was for this sample of quiz marks. To do this, we could make use of a very handy function, `mean()`, as follows:

```{r}
mean(quiz_9am)
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Calculate the mean of each of the two sets of scores you created.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
Whether you save the output of the `mean()` command is up to you!

```{r}
mean(quiz_9am)
mean(quiz_6pm)
```
:::

Calculate the **difference** in the mean of each of the two sets of scores.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
Here are two options for accomplishing this.

The first option is to save each mean value in a new object (if you didn't do that already), then subtract one mean from the other. This is very easy to read, but a bit inefficient.

```{r}
mean_9am <- mean(quiz_9am)
mean_6pm <- mean(quiz_6pm)

mean_9am - mean_6pm
```

The second option is to do everything in one command, which takes a bit more effort to parse but is more succinct.

```{r}
mean(quiz_9am) - mean(quiz_6pm)
```
:::

What is the class of these objects?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
Either one will do.

```{r}
class(quiz_9am)
```

So, an object has the class of the data it contains.
:::
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Object Names vs Strings"}
You may have been surprised to see that the class of these objects is numeric, rather than character - even though the name of the object is a character string. To find out the class of the object, R looks at what that object contains, not at the name of the object itself. We already saw that `quiz_9am` (or whatever your object is called) contains only numbers; so, R tells us that it's a numeric vector.

One more example to emphasize this point, because it's often a source of confusion when starting out with R. If we want to ask R the class of the **string** "quiz_9am", we would need to put it in quotes, and we'd get a different answer:

```{r}
class("quiz_9am")
```

The key thing here is that **objects have the class of the data they contain**, and are not character data; and whenever you want to use an object, you **must not** use quotation marks. On the other hand, if you want to input character data into R, you **must** use quotation marks. Otherwise, R will look for an object or function with that name, which will likely produce a "cannot find object" error.
:::

Because we've used the assignment operator, R doesn't print out the years. Instead, the output of our calculation is saved as the object `birth_year.` Hmm - didn't we already have an object called `birth_year`, though? What happened to it?

::: callout-important
### Important: Overwriting Objects

You might notice that we already had an object called `birth_year` that we created above. R, again, does only and exactly what you ask it to do. Unlike, say, a word processer, that will give you a warning if you try to save two documents in the same folder with the same name, R won't ask you if you're sure you want to overwrite an existing object with new information - it will just **do it**. If you have a look in your Environment, you will see that the previous version of `birth_year`, containing only your birth year, has been quietly replaced with the new one containing the vector of birth years you just created.

This can be a good thing, because you can easily update the information stored in an object with changes, edits, or new information. However, it also means that you can overwrite or replace data when you don't want to, if you use the same object name.

This is why it is so important to keep track of all of the commands and changes you make to your data. If you accidentally replace your dataset with, say, a single word or number with an error in your code, you can easily retrace your steps and avoid redoing work.

If you are interested in understanding this process of assigning and replacing the contents of objects better, the aside below explains it in more depth.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Can you actually change an object?

Think of objects as boxes. The names of the objects are only *labels*, and you can store anything you like inside them. However, unlike in the physical world, objects in R cannot truly change. You can put stuff in and take stuff out, and that's pretty much it. Unlike boxes, though, when you take stuff out of objects, you only take out a **copy** of its contents. The original contents of the box remain intact. Of course, you can do whatever you want (within limits) to the stuff once you've taken it out of the box, but you are only modifying the copy. The key thing to remember is that unless you put that modified stuff into a box, R will forget about it as soon as it's done with it. In other words, if you want to "save" any changes you make, you must assign them to an object in order to keep them.

Now, as you probably know, you can call your boxes (objects) whatever you want (again, within certain limits). This means that that you can call the new box the same as the old one, as we saw with `birth_year` above. When that happens, R basically takes the label off the old box, pastes it on the new one, and burns the old box. So even though some operations in R may look like they change objects, what's actually happening is that R copies their content, modifies it, stores the result in a different object, puts the same label on it, and discards the original object. Understanding this mechanism will make things much easier!

Putting the above into practice, this is how you "change" an R object:

```{r}
# put 1 into an object (box) called a
a <- 1

# copy the content of a, add 1 to it and store it in an object b
b <- a + 1

# copy what's inside b and put it in a new object called a
# discarding ("overwriting") the old object a
a <- b

# now see what's inside of a
# (by copying its content and pasting it in the console)
a
```

Of course, you can just cut out the middleman (creating an object b). So to increment `a` by another 1, we can do:

```{r}
a <- a + 1

a
```
:::
:::

We will talk further about using scripts and writing multiple commands below; but first, we'll need to have a look at a very important type of object in R: the function.

## Functions

Functions are like verbs in the R language - they're how R *does* anything. In order to use them, you need to "translate" the command you want to give R into a verb (function) it can understand.

### Basics and Help

Let's look at an example of how this translation might work. For this example, I'm going to use a number I generated earlier: the mean of the `quiz_6pm` group, which was `r mean(quiz_6pm)`, which I'd like to round to two decimal places - a common task for reporting results in APA style.

If we want R to do this for us, we have to write this command in a way that R can understand. First, we need to know what function corresponds to the English verb "round" - that is, what function will do the same action that we want R to perform. We're lucky in this case: the function in R is also called `round()`.

We know that we're looking at a function in R because functions often have a name followed by brackets (and nothing else in R does). That is, they have the general form `function_name()`. Inside the brackets, we can add more information to the function to complete our command, although not all functions require any more information.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Try running the `round()` function.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
round()
```

Unsurprisingly, R has given us an error. This is an **informative** error, though - that is, the error gives of some sort of intelligible clue about what's gone wrong. Namely, it tells us that `round()` can't just work without additional information (i.e. "required arguments"). Imagine, for instance, if you wanted a colleague to round `r mean(quiz_6pm)` to two decimal places, and in order to ask them to do that, you just shouted "ROUND!" at them. Similarly, R has objected to this, telling you that it needs more information in order to do what you've asked it to.
:::
:::

What we want to do, "Round the number `r mean(quiz_6pm)` to two decimal places", has two more important pieces of information that we need to tell R: what number we want to round (`r mean(quiz_6pm)`) and how many decimal places we want to round it to (2). So, how do we say this in R? To find out, let's look at the help documentation.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Open the help documentation for the `round()` function by running `?round()` or `help(round)` in the Console.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Help Documentation"}
Help documentation is information, like instruction manuals, built into R about how individual functions work. Function documentation varies wildly in helpfulness and completeness, but it's a useful place to check first if you want to find out what a function does. You can access the help documentation in a few different ways: by running `?function_name` or `help(function_name)` in the Console, or by clicking on the "Help" tab in the Files section of RStudio and using the Find box to search for the function.
:::

The first section, "Description", varies quite a bit in intelligibility, depending on how complex the function is. Here, if we ignore the information about the other function including in this document, we can see that we have a useful description of `round()` that tells us that it rounds numbers (that's a good sign) to a certain number of decimal places. That's exactly what we want, so how do we use it?

Let's scroll down to "Usage", which gives examples of what the function looks like. You can see that the basic structure of this function is `round(x, digits = 0)`. It seems like we need to add some more information in the brackets of our function - but how do we interpret `x` and `digits = 0`?

### Arguments

The information inside a function's brackets to give it the information it needs to work are called **arguments**. Each argument in a function is separated by a comma, so we can see from `round(x, digits = 0)` that the `round()` function can take two arguments. How many arguments a function has depends on the function; some (like `Sys.Date()`) don't need any arguments to run. One of the most useful parts of a function's help documentation is the "Arguments" section, which tells you what each of the function's arguments are and how to use them.

There are two main types of arguments: named and unnamed arguments. Conveniently, the arguments of `round()` give us one example of each.

#### Unnamed Arguments

The first argument to `round()` is simply `x`. Just like in maths, `x` is a placeholder for some number or numbers (a "numeric vector", which should sound familiar now) that you want to pass to the function. This is common notation in many functions: `x`, often the first argument in a function, is often the placeholder for the information you want to use the function on. In our case, we just have one number we want to round, so that's what we should replace with `x`.

This argument has no default so it must be provided, or the function won't run.

#### Named Arguments

The second argument of `round()` is a named argument, `digits = 0`. You can think of named arguments like settings that change the way a function works, often with only certain allowable values. Here we can see that the name of the argument is `digits`; the name before the `=` sign tells R which setting we want to change.

The help documentation tells us that `digits` should be an "integer indicating the number of decimal places...to be used." We can also see in "Usage" that this argument has a default value, `digits = 0`. That means that if we don't explicitly include the argument `digits` when we use the function, by default the `round()` function will round the number you give it to 0 decimal places. Named arguments frequently, but not always, have a default, and it's important to check so the function doesn't quietly do something unexpected.

Default values of arguments are really useful, because the default is usually the most frequently used setting. It means you don't have to specify every single aspect of a function every time you use it, as long as you want the function to work that way! In our case, we actually wanted `round()` to round to two decimal places, not 0. So, in our command, we should change the setting from the default, 0, to 2.

### Using Functions

Now that we know what both of these arguments mean, we can change them to actually translate the English sentence "Round the number `r mean(quiz_6pm)` to two decimal places" into a command that R can work with. We'll explicitly write out each argument so we know what they are doing.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Use the `round()` function to round `r mean(quiz_6pm)` to two decimal places.

If you prefer, you can do this with one of the means you calculated for your own scores earlier.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
## Using the actual value from my earlier calculation
round(55.85714, 2)

## Using a nested function - that is, calculating the mean and then rounding it!
round(mean(quiz_6pm), 2)
```
:::
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Order of Arguments" collapse="true"}
If you want to, you can achieve the same result by changing the order of the arguments. Because we have written the names of both arguments, R can still do what we want it to do:

```{r}
round(digits = 2, x = 55.85714)
```

We can also, to some degree, drop the names of the arguments, as long as R can still understand what we're trying to do:

```{r}
round(digits = 2, 55.85714)
```

Here I left out the `x =`. R can still understand this because `round()` only takes two arguments, and we explicitly told it what value belongs to `digits`, so it assumes the second number must be `x`.

```{r}
round(55.85714, 2)
```

This time I dropped both argument names. R can still understand this because when you don't specify which input goes with which argument, R will assume they should go in the default order given in the help documentation. So, R has automatically assigned 55.85714 to `x` and 2 to `digits`, which is what we wanted.

As I use R more and more, I find that I name arguments more consistently, even though I know how the function works and dropping them is more efficient (at least in terms of typing). That's because when I come back from lunch, or the next day, or six months later to revisit the same code, it's much easier to recall what it all means when it's well-annotated. So, I strongly recommend getting in the habit of including argument names in your code as a favour to your future self, and to avoid situations like this:

```{r}
round(2, 55.85714)
```

Here, since we didn't specify, R assumed that 2 was the number we wanted to round. This isn't what we wanted - but R has no way of knowing this. It always assumes that what we typed was precisely what we intended to ask R to do.
:::

#### Passing Multiple Values to Arguments

A last important aspect of using functions is to remember that each argument in a function can only take a single object or value as input. For example, we saw above that we put the single value 55.85714 into the `x` argument of `round()`. But what if we wanted to round more than one number? We don't want to have to write a new `round()` command for every number, even though we could do this if we particularly enjoyed doing a lot of tedious and repetitive typing:

```{r}
round(55.85714, 2)
## ughhhh
round(59.54, 2)
## noooooo :(
round(0.198, 2)
## thanks I hate it
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Before you go on, have a go using a single `round()` command to round all three numbers at once.

*Hint*: Refer to [Vectors](#vectors).
:::

So what happens if we try to put all of those numbers into `round()`? We might first try this:

```{r}
round(55.85714, 59.54, 0.198, 2)
```

Once again, R tells us that this doesn't work by throwing an error. R has tried to do what we wanted, but the `round()` function only allows a max of two arguments, and we've given it four. Behind the scenes, R has tried to run `round(x = 55.85714, digits = 59.54...` and can't proceed from there because it doesn't know what to do with the last two numbers. So, what we need to do is find a way to put all three numbers that we want to round into the first `x` argument together. If only there was a way to **c**oncatenate them together...

You may have guessed where this is going: one method we could use would be to put the three numbers we want to round into a single object, and then pass that object to `round()` as the `x` argument. We already saw that we can combine any number of things together into a single vector using the `c()` function.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution"}
```{r}
## Create an intermediate object to contain the numbers
numbers <- c(55.85714, 59.54, 0.198)
round(numbers, digits = 2)

## Put the vector of numbers into round() directly
round(c(55.85714, 59.54, 0.198), digits = 2)
```
:::

Here we can see a good example of a function inside another function. You can stack, or "nest", functions inside each other like this as much as you like, although it can become difficult to read the code or keep track of what it's doing. (There's a great solution to this problem that we'll make extensive use of in the future: the pipe operator.)

That's looking like some proper R code! Very nicely done.

::: {.callout-tip title="Help Documentation, Revisited"}
Before we leave the `round()` function altogether, let's take a look at two more useful sections of the help documentation. Depending on what you are trying to do, the "Details" section can tell you more about how exactly the function works - how it behaves in certain situations, or how it handles unusual or difficult cases. If a function isn't doing what you expect it to, this is a good place to look for an explanation.

Finally, at the end of the documentation you can find the "Examples" section. If you are learning to use a new function, this section can give you a template for writing your own commands. You can also click the "Run examples" link, which will run the code in the Examples section for you so you can see what the function will do.
:::

## Let's Get Testing

Let's put all of this together and have a look at what we can already do with the skills in this tutorial. R has many, many uses, but one of its core purposes is statistical analysis - and we already know more than enough to do this.

### Comparing Groups with *t*-test

We've created two objects that contain scores from two different groups - scores we made up, but we will get to real data soon (in the next tutorial!). For now, one common statistical test we could run on data like this is a *t*-test, which is a hypothesis test essentially quantifying whether scores come from the same or different populations.

The function to run a *t*-test in R is `t.test()`, so let's have a go!

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Exercise"}
Bring up the help documentation for `t.test()` and use it to run a *t*-test comparing your two sets of scores.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution"}
```{r}
t.test(quiz_9am, quiz_6pm)
```
:::
:::

There are a lot of options in the `t.test()` function, which can be used, through different arguments, to run almost any variety of *t*-test you can think of. In this case, though, the code is quite simple, because we want all the default settings (for a two-sample, independent test), so we only need to provide `x` and `y`, our two numeric vectors.

Note that the output mentions "Welch Two Sample t-test", which is a robust version of the test that does **not** assume equal variances. This is the version that is taught to undergraduates, because we have not at this point introduced the process of assumption testing. If you definitely know that the variances *are* equal and you definitely want Student's *t*-test, you can instead change the default setting:

```{r}
t.test(quiz_9am, quiz_6pm, var.equal = TRUE)
```

In the next tutorial, we'll see how to turn this rather ugly R output automatically into beautifully formatted reporting like this:

```{r}
#| echo: false

quiz_t <- t.test(quiz_9am, quiz_6pm, var.equal = TRUE)
```

> We compared mean scores between two groups, one who took the quiz in a 9am practical session (*M* = `r round(quiz_t$estimate[1], 2)`) and the other who took the quiz in a 6pm practical session (*M* =`r round(quiz_t$estimate[2], 2)`, *M*~diff~ = `r round(quiz_t$estimate[1] - quiz_t$estimate[2], 2)`). There was no statistically significant difference in scores between timing groups (*t*(`r round(quiz_t$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(quiz_t$statistic, 2)`, *p* = `r round(quiz_t$p.value, 3)`, 95% CI \[`r round(quiz_t$conf.int[1], 2)`, `r round(quiz_t$conf.int[2], 2)`\]).
