distribution,Categorical,"Channel through which the study was completed, either ""preview"" or ""anonymous"" (the latter representing ""real"" data). Note that this variable has been randomly generated and does NOT reflect genuine responses."
consent,Categorical,"Whether the participant read and consented to participate (""Yes"") or not (""No""). Note that this variable has been randomly generated and does NOT reflect genuine responses; all participants in this dataset did originally consent to participate."

age,Numeric,Age in years. Note that this variable has been randomly generated and does NOT reflect genuine responses.
mcq,Categorical,"Independent variable for MCQ question condition, whether the participant saw MCQ questions about mathematics (""maths"") or statistics (""stats"")."
stars_[sub][number],Numeric,"Item on the Statistics Anxiety Rating Scale. There are three subscales, denoted with [sub] in the name:<br>- [test]: Test anxiety<br>- [help]: Asking for Help<br>- [int]: Interpretation Anxiety.<br>[num] corresponds to the item number. Responses given on a Likert scale from 1 (no anxiety) to 5 (a great deal of anxiety), so higher scores reflect higher levels of anxiety."
stars_m_[sub][number],Numeric,"Item on the Statistics Anxiety Rating Scale - Maths, a modified version of the STARS with all references to statistics replaced with maths. There are three subscales, denoted with [sub] in the name:<br>- [test]: Test anxiety<br>- [help]: Asking for Help<br>- [int]: Interpretation Anxiety.<br>[num] corresponds to the item number. Responses given on a Likert scale from 1 (no anxiety) to 5 (a great deal of anxiety), so higher scores reflect higher levels of anxiety."
rmars_[sub][number],Numeric,"Item on the Revised Maths Anxiety Rating Scale. There are three subscales, denoted with [sub] in the name:<br>- [test]: Test anxiety<br>- [num]: Numerical Task Anxiety<br>- [course]: Course anxiety.<br>[num] corresponds to the item number. Responses given on a Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much), so higher scores reflect higher levels of anxiety."
rmars_s_[sub][number],Numeric,"Item on the Revised Maths Anxiety Rating Scale - Statistics, a modified version of the MARS with all references to maths replaced with statistics. There are three subscales, denoted with [sub] in the name:<br>- [test]: Test anxiety<br>- [num]: Numerical Task Anxiety<br>- [course]: Course anxiety.<br>[num] corresponds to the item number. Responses given on a Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much), so higher scores reflect higher levels of anxiety."

[time] denotes one of two times of administration: before completing the MCQ task (""pre""), or after (""post""). [num] corresponds to the item number. Responses given on a Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much so), so higher scores reflect higher levels of anxiety."
mcq_stats_[num],Categorical,"Correct (1) or incorrect (0) response to MCQ questions about statistics, covering mean ([number] = 1), standard deviation (2), confidence intervals (3), beta coefficient (4), and standard error (5). "
mcq_maths_[num],Categorical,"Correct (1) or incorrect (0) response to MCQ questions about maths, covering mean ([number] = 1), standard deviation (2), confidence intervals (3), beta coefficient (4), and standard error (5). "
